# Application gallery

These are captures of the production Metis form and its real backend responses,
rendered into an 800×600 software framebuffer through Iris. The runnable
[presentation example](../../examples/presentation.rs) uses bounded IPC and a
Moirai worker, asserts values and audit outcomes, and checks text geometry before
capturing each state. It does not create native controls or execute in a browser.
The separate [process demonstration](getting-started.md) tests actual child processes.

## Initial form

![Initial form](images/form.svg)

The defaults are 72.50 kg, 4.00 mg/mL and 0.500 mcg/kg/min. No result exists yet.

## Successful request

![Backend result](images/form-success.svg)

The example establishes a session and submits patient `demo`, weight 60 kg,
concentration 2 mg/mL and dose 0.2 mcg/kg/min. The backend returns 0.72 mg/hour
and 0.36 mL/hour at audit sequence 2. The MAC is present but not verified by the
frontend. These synthetic values demonstrate the protocol, not treatment guidance.

## Edit invalidates the result

![Edited form awaiting submission](images/form-edited.svg)

Changing weight to 80 kg immediately clears the old rate and MAC. No request has
been sent for these edited inputs; the form displays idle.

## Rejection and correction

![Backend rejects zero weight](images/form-rejected.svg)

The next request uses zero weight. The backend rejects it with code `0x3001` at
audit sequence 3. No prior result remains on screen. Full diagnostics are available
in the typed `FormState::Rejected` value.

![Corrected inputs produce a result](images/form-corrected.svg)

Restoring weight to 60 kg succeeds on the same session at audit sequence 4.

## Disconnection and reconnection

![Closed connection clears the result](images/form-disconnected.svg)

The example joins the finite worker, which closes the real peer endpoint. A
subsequent submission reports `0x4002`, clears the result and shows a closed
session. Synchronization uses worker completion, not a timed sleep.

![New session produces the changed result](images/form-recovered.svg)

A new app and backend session submit weight 80 kg and return 0.96 mg/hour and
0.48 mL/hour. Reconnection never silently retries an uncertain transaction.

## Reproduce and review

```text
python scripts/verify.py
```

The Rust example writes fixed `output/form*.bmp` and `output/form*.svg` files.
SVG paths encode the actual raster; they do not rebuild layout as SVG text.
The gate removes previous required captures before execution, asserts all seven
fresh outputs, and compares each with its committed image. Output names are
reused on subsequent runs. For an intentional visual change:

```text
python scripts/verify.py --update-snapshots
python scripts/verify.py
```

Inspect the generated images before accepting the baseline. The gate records
source and image hashes in `output/verification.json`. Browser/OS capture,
responsive pending/cancellation and automated difference images remain part of
the [visual scenario work](../VERIFICATION.md#visual-contract).
